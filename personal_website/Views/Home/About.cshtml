        <p>After brief careers as a Frozen Yogurt Peddler, Bicycle Messenger, Ski Technician, Auto Mechanic and Cook I finally found my calling as a Software Engineer.</p>
        <p>
            I’m currently working at Advent Software, Inc. in San Francisco.  At Advent, I have worked on Advent Revenue Center, an invoicing and revenue management application.   I also led the development of an internal operations portal that monitored server and application software logs across customer implementations.

            I’m interested in building web applications that enable businesses to quickly understand complex business problems.  I especially like creating charts with the <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> JavaScript library.
